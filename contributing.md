# tools.ampersandjs.com suggestion guidelines

Hi, thanks for your interest! 

The criteria for modules that get added here, is a bit subjective. It's a curated list, after all.

But the criteria roughly goes like this:

1. Is it useful for devs building applications with Ampersand.js
2. All dependencies should be installable via npm.
3. It should contain only the minimal set of dependencies.


Things we won't include:

1. Anything that depends on existance of a global.

Thanks!
